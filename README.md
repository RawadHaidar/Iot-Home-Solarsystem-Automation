# Overview

This project has three main targets:
* FIRST: Control the electricity inside my home using my mobile from anywhere.
* SECOND: Automating the solar system output according to the sunlight intensity.
* THIRD: Interfacing the solar inverter data on a mobile application.

## First target
Done, using Firebase realtime database with flutter UI, ESP8266 and three ralay modules.

## Second target
To be done later, using BH1750 light intensity sensor.

## Third target
To be done later, using ENC28J60 ethernet module to sniff data from solar inverter using LAN communication.
